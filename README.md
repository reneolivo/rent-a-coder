Rent-a-Coder
============

A demo for diffeerent electronic payment methods.


Requirements
============

- NodeJS v0.10+
- NPM v1.4+
- Bower 1.3+ (Yeoman works too)


Installation
============

Clone the repo, open the command line and navigate to the repo folder.

Run ```npm install``` then change directories to the ```public``` folder and run ```bower install```.

Optionally, if you need some mock records (which I bet you will) run ```npm run-script mock-records```. Beware that this will wipe out any information on the DB.
